"Hi, I'm Nazar, a 19-year-old junior frontend developer. Currently, I'm studying micro and nanosystems technology at Franko University of Lviv. In addition to my university education, I'm actively working on improving my skills through the Rolling Scope School frontend course.

Programming has fascinated me since a young age. However, I realized that my university and school didn't provide me with all the necessary knowledge to excel in frontend development. So, I took the initiative to enroll in various courses.

As I delved deeper into frontend development, I discovered a true passion for it. Creating engaging user interfaces and bringing designs to life brings me immense joy. I faced challenges head-on, dedicated myself to continuous learning, and gradually developed the essential skills for a frontend developer.

During my self-guided learning, I've come to realize the importance of having a mentor. I yearned for someone who could guide me, provide constructive criticism, and point me in the right direction.

During my journey as a junior frontend developer, I undertook a project to create a sapper game using vanilla JavaScript. This project provided an excellent opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills while diving deeper into the world of frontend development.


Designing the algorithm to reveal nearby empty cells when a cell with no mines nearby is clicked was particularly challenging. It involved using recursive function calls and going through the grid to uncover neighboring cells until reaching cells next to mines. I had to carefully test and debug the algorithm to make sure it worked perfectly.

Overcoming these challenges brought me great satisfaction throughout the project. Each obstacle presented a chance for growth, and I gained valuable insights while improving my problem-solving skills. The project also taught me the importance of organizing code, making it easy to read, and documenting it for collaboration and future maintenance.

In summary, creating the sapper game was a rewarding experience that helped me solidify my frontend development skills. It expanded my knowledge of JavaScript, improved my logical thinking, and laid a strong foundation for future projects. I'm excited to tackle more challenges and continue refining my skills as I progress in my frontend development journey.
